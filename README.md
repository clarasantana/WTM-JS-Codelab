Step-by-step tutorial into front-end development. Created to use as guide on a codelab presented at JSdayBR.

I was invited to host a JS Codelab on JSday Recife 2015, then I created this repo as a simple guide into front-end development.
Many thanks to Raquel Guimar√£es from ThoughtWorks for helping me.
